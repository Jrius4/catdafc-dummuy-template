              <p>
                  Our first season in the 3rd Division was well; as we finished runners up.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We are glad with the philosophy of the club which interests and attacks fans from different areas to come and watch the great style of football the boys play. more to that, recently during the Cranes Regional Tours, we had four of our boys called up for the Kampala Select Team.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We are grateful for the support and love from you our dear fans. Thank you. We are the #LufulaBoys.
